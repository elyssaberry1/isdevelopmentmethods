Statement/Problem:

A major Travel Company is wanting to improve their customer service skills during their inbound and outbound calls, which involves the process of selling travel holiday packages to customers (or potential customers). They aim to deliver high level Relationship Managers (RM) to the customer, through implementing a system that will provide assistance to RM's in the process of matching customer profiles using a 'Profiler Tool', with the RM's built profile and skill matrix. This will subsequently help maximise the performance of RM's during their calls, by matching their product knowledge and skills with the end buyer(s) and thus improving customer satisfaction and lead to an increase in sales. 


Objectives:

- Increase purchases of holiday packages by 20% in the next 2 months during inbound and outbound calls. 
- Direct customer calls to the most suitable Relationship Manager (RM) available within a 30 seconds to a 2 minute wait time. 
- The system will adjust an RM's profile within 20 minutes - 30 minutes after every call performance in selling packages and providing effective customer service. 


Assumptions:
- there's a system developer that maintains and improves the system.


POV - Customer:
User - the end-customer (or potential customer) that wants to purchase a holiday package 
Need -  customer's need RM's with rich knowledge (eg. particular destination they are wanting to travel to) 
Insight - customers aren't being convinced enough by RM's performance in selling packages during their calls. 

POV - Employee: 
User - the RM from the call management centre trying to sell holiday packages 
Need - to have well informed RM's delivering high level information to the right customer
Insight - currently RM's aren't being effectively matched with the end-customer (there needs to be a system that matches the customer Profiler Tool and the RM's profile and skills matrix)

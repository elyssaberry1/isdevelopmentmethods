Statement:

The Travel Company's goal is to implement a system that will deliver high level Relationship Managers (RM) from the call management centre to the end-customer (during the call), to effectively increase sales and improve customer satisfaction. This system will provide assistance to RM's by matching customer profiles from 'Profiler Tool' with the RM's built profile and skill matrix, in order to deliver maximum performance in sales of holiday packages. 




(Match customers based on RM performance and product knowledge 
Efficiently updating the system with RMs performances in selling packages
